Searches and tests SQL dorks to find vulnerable sites.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Various libraries found in requirements.txt

# Features
Searches google based on either pre-provided dorks or allows custom entry. Returns and tests as many results as you'd like.

The provided dorks are cat, id, article, page, and bookid.

# Issues
Currently there is no error handling (list index for entering an invalid dork selection, etc.) If you search too often google may also block you. I recommend either waiting or using a proxy in that scenario.
